# Project Setup Guide

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository (Local Setup)

To get started, open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JrGaddam/cook_note.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd cook_note
```

### 2. Running the Project Locally

Before running the project, make sure you have all the dependencies installed (if applicable). Follow these steps:

#### Using Node.js:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Running in GitHub Codespaces

If you prefer not to set up the project locally, you can run it directly in GitHub Codespaces:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **"Code"** button and select **"Open with Codespaces"**.
3. If no Codespace exists, create a new one.
4. Wait for the environment to initialize, then start working!

### 4. Keeping Your Repository Updated

To ensure you have the latest changes, run the following commands:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

If you make changes and want to push them back:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```
